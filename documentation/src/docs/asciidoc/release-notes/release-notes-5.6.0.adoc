[[release-notes-5.6.0-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* https://docs.gradle.org/6.0-rc-1/userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html[Gradle
  Module Metadata] is now published for all artifacts.
* OSGi metadata is now published in all binary JARs.
* Javadoc now contains a module API overview page.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* The `EventConditions.nestedContainer()` method in the Engine Test Kit now correctly
  handles events from multiple levels of nested classes.
* Module `org.junit.platform.launcher` now reads `java.logging` due to usage of types in
  package `java.util.logging`.
* Method `assertIterableEquals()` in `Assertions` no longer throws a `StackOverflowError`
  when comparing iterables with components that themselves implement `Iterable`.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `Launcher` now propagates errors during test discovery by default instead of only
  logging and thereby potentially hiding them. In order to restore the old, lenient
  behavior, you can set the `junit.platform.discovery.listener.default` configuration
  parameter to `logging`.
* To support the above feature consistently, a new `EngineDiscoveryListener` interface was
  introduced. `TestEngine` implementations should now notify the listener that can be
  accessed via the `EngineDiscoveryRequest.getDiscoveryListener()` method about each
  processed `DiscoverySelector`. Test engines that use `EngineDiscoveryRequestResolver` do
  not have to make any changes.
* In the `EngineTestKit` API, the `all()`, `containers()`, and `tests()` methods in
  `EngineExecutionResults` have been deprecated in favor of the new `allEvents()`,
  `containerEvents()`, and `testEvents()` methods, respectively. The deprecated methods
  will be removed in JUnit Platform 1.7.0.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Running all tests with any tags or without any tags at all is now supported
  by using the special expressions `any()` and `none()`.
* `ReflectionSupport.findNestedClasses(...)` now detects cycles within inner class
  hierarchies. Consult the Javadoc for details.
* New methods in `DiscoverySelectors` to select and execute individual tests in
  inherited nested classes, via specific selectors (`NestedClassSelector` and
  `NestedMethodSelector`).
* New `printFailuresTo(PrintWriter, int)` method in `TestExecutionSummary` that allows one
  to specify the maximum number of lines to print for exception stack traces.
* `TestExecutionSummary.Failure` is now serializable.
* `ThrowableCollector.toTestExecutionResult()` is now public.
* Exceptions thrown by test engines during discovery and execution are now reported to
  `TestExecutionListeners`.
* The `junit-platform-commons` module no longer has a dependency on the `java.compiler`
  module (in terms of the Java Module System). Specifically, a new internal utility has
  been introduced in `PackageUtils` that implements functionality equivalent to
  `javax.lang.model.SourceVersion.isName(CharSequence)` from the `java.compiler` module.
* Module `org.junit.platform.console` now provides a `java.util.spi.ToolProvider`
  implementation that can be acquired by `ToolProvider.findFirst("junit")` when running
  on Java 9 or above.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* When `@Nested` is used, the temporary directory is now also injected into instance
  fields of enclosing classes annotated with `@TempDir`.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `@EnabledIf` and `@DisabledIf` have been removed from Jupiter's API. Script-based
  condition APIs and their supporting implementations were deprecated in JUnit Jupiter 5.5
  with the intent to remove them in JUnit Jupiter 5.6. Users must now rely on a
  combination of other built-in conditions or create and use a custom implementation of
  `ExecutionCondition` to evaluate the same conditions.
* The default `@Order` value for non-annotated `@RegisterExtension` fields and test
  methods is now `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2` instead of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. If you had
  previously assigned extension fields or test methods an explicit order greater than
  `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2`, this may be a breaking change for you.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Support for multi-character delimiters in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`.
* Support for custom `null` values in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`.
* Documented support for comments in CSV files loaded via `@CsvFileSource`.
* Auto-detection of enum type from method signature for `@EnumSource`.
* Parameter names are now included in the default display name of a `@ParameterizedTest`
  invocation (if they are present in the bytecode). The `{argumentsWithNames}` pattern
  can also be used in custom names.
* New `@EnabledForJreRange` and `@DisabledForJreRange` annotations for enabling or
  disabling test execution over a range of JRE versions.
* `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable`, `@DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable`,
  `@EnabledIfSystemProperty`, and `@DisabledIfSystemProperty` may now be used as
  _repeatable_ annotations. In other words, it is now possible to declare each of those
  annotations multiple times on a test interface, test class, or test method.
* `JAVA_15` has been added to the `JRE` enum for use with JRE-based execution conditions.
* The `@TempDir` extension now makes an attempt to delete non-writable files by making
  them writable first.
* The default `@Order` value for non-annotated `@RegisterExtension` fields and test
  methods is now `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2` instead of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This allows
  `@Order` annotated fields and methods to be explicitly ordered after non-annotated
  fields and methods. For example, this allows _before_ callback extensions to be
  registered last and _after_ callback extensions to be registered first, relative to
  other programmatically registered extensions.
* New `junit.jupiter.execution.timeout.mode` configuration parameter to control whether
  timeouts are applied to tests. Supported values include `enabled`, `disabled`, and
  `disabled_on_debug`.
* New `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback` interface that defines the API for extensions that
  wish to process test instances *after* they have been used in tests and *before* they
  are destroyed.
* New `TypeBasedParameterResolver<T>` abstract base class that serves as a generic adapter
  for the `ParameterResolver` API and simplifies the implementation of a custom resolver
  that supports parameters of a specific type.
* `InvocationInterceptor` extensions may now explicitly `skip()` an intercepted
  invocation. This allows executing the invocation by other means â€” for example, in a
  forked JVM.
* Discovery of `@Nested` test classes that form a cycle now results in an exception that
  halts execution of the JUnit Jupiter test engine instead of infinite recursion.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* JUnit 3 suites with duplicate test names are now reported correctly.

==== New Features and Improvements

* To support adoption of the recent JUnit 4.13 release, the Vintage engine now requires
  the new version in its POM and Gradle Module Metadata. However, if you absolutely have
  to stay on 4.12, you can safely downgrade the dependency manually because the Vintage
  engine will remain compatible with 4.12.
* Performance improvements for projects with a large number of tests.
* Performance improvements for test classes with a large number of methods.
